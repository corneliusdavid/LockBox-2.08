# LockBox-2.08
Version 2.08 of the source code from the old TurboPower open-sourced LockBox Library, upgraded for Delphi 2010 and XE (32-bit only), but still contains all the old packages as well. This is maintained for compatibility of an existing application and I thought perhaps someone else might find it useful.

NOTE: Version 2.07 was the last stable version commercially sold by TurboPower and was made for Delphi 7. This is version 2.08 which was a beta version to support up through Delphi 2009 (originally code-named tiburon). I've found it to work well and have used it with Delphi 2010 for quite some time. I recently added Delphi XE packages. For support of newer versions of Delphi, see the list below.

For more current versions of Lockbox and for 64-bit support, see the following repositories:
