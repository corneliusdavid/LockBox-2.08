# LockBox-2.08
Version 2.08 of the source code from the old TurboPower open-sourced LockBox Library, upgraded for newer (32-bit only) versions of Delphi. This is maintained for compatibility of existing applications and I thought perhaps someone else might find it useful.

NOTE: Version 2.07 was the last stable version commercially sold by TurboPower and was made for Delphi 7. This is version 2.08 which was a beta version to support up through Delphi 2009. I've found it to work well and have used it with Delphi 2010, XE, and XE2 for quite some time. I recently added Delphi 10 Seattle, 10.1 Berlin, 10.2 Tokyo, and 10.3 Rio packages, but new development will be using LockBox 3.

For more current versions of Lockbox and for 64-bit support, see the following repositories:
